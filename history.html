        <h3>Majorville is located on Lake Michigan where Pine Creek empties into Lake Michigan just south of Esky Road.  Today this is one of the most popular swimming beaches in the Lakeshore, but in the 1870s and 1880s, Majorville was a booming lumber town!

            John Major settled with his wife Julia and daughter Anna in Northern Michigan. He began buying land in Platte and Lake townships as investments and, in late 1854, purchased the 122 acres. 
       Lumber speculators soon arrived looking for stands of white pine. Most of the forest in this area was hardwood, but there were some stands of white pine inland from Pine Lake.
            In 1865, Daniel Thomas and William Woodward built a dock on John Majorâ€™s property on Lake Michigan, just north of Pine Creek. The sawmill was built on the south side of Pine Creek not far from Lake Michigan.
            Mill operation began in 1869 for the purpose of producing white pine lumber, and the town of Majorville was established.
